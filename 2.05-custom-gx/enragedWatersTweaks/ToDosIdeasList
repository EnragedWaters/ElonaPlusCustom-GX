// CUSTOM TWEAKS BY ENRAGED WATERS//
//Idea is to keep tweaks in seperate .hsp for personal use/updating game
//Not idea for gitHub but the logic is all there so creating a gitHub branch is straight forward

/* TO DOS
-AI tweak - > Get Crunked -> Increase chance for npcs to drink during party time
-Spact idea -> Cooking Party - > either a re-roll or +1 to cooked dish.
-Fishing tweak - make it so fishing skill does something past 40
-Create adventurer hospital

//cc = CHARA_PLAYER // cc = Current player
//tc = target Character //      tc = map(tlocx, tlocy, 1) - 1       <-  is usual declaration
//cdata(CDATA_GOLD, CHARA_PLAYER) // For Obtaining cdata on line 3552 in mod.hsp such as position, sex, and hunger.
//if ( sdata(SKILL_NORMAL_NEGOTIATION, cc) // For obtaining skill levels such as casting level. Found on line 190 in mod.hsp
//efp is power effectiveness      efp = calcspellpower(efid, cc)

//flt function sorta works as a "reset" option before creating npcs to avoid accidentally giving them unique properties not otherwise specified
